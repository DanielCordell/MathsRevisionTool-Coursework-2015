# Maths Revision Tool Coursework Thing...Yeah
Online backup of my coursework (also so I can look back at this in 5 years and laugh at myself for how foolish I was/cry as I haven't improved in 5 years).

A program that generates random maths questions based on user's preferences (from school years 7 - 10).
Saves and loads settings from a local file, and keeps a local highscore.
Has a gui and everything (oooooh).
